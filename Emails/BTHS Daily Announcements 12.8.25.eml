OSEST TO THE DEADLINE ROLLER SKATING IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA When: The tradit=
ion takes place annually from December 16th to the 24th, leading up to Chri=
stmas Eve. What: People roller skate through the streets all night, often s=
inging Christmas songs. The night of skating culminates in attending the ea=
rly morning mass, Misa de gallo, which starts at 5 or 6 a.m. Where: The tra=
dition is most prominent in Caracas, the capital city, but it is celebrated=
 throughout the country. =EF=BB=BF How: Roads are often closed to car traff=
ic during these hours to create a safe space for skaters. Why: It started i=
n the 1950s, and one theory is that it was a way for children to use their =
Christmas roller skate gifts on Christmas Day, which is a hot day in Venezu=
ela. It has since become an important part of the cultural and religious ce=
lebrations of the holidays.  HeARTwork Against Hate Student Competition We=
